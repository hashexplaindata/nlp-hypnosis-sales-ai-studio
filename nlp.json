{
  "Foundations": "Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) studies how language, thought and behavior interact. Core ideas: map vs territory, sensory acuity, outcome focus, flexibility. Do: use simple sensory language (see/hear/feel). Don't: lecture. Sticky: Experiment, don't preach.",
  "Observation": "Establish a 2-3 minute neutral baseline. Watch breathing, blink rate, posture, tone, facial micro-expressions. Look for clusters of signals (3+ cues) before acting.",
  "Rapport": "Match breathing, tone and key predicates. After 6 breaths of subtle matching, lead (change pace or posture slightly). Keep it ethical and authentic.",
  "Anchoring": "Anchoring: 1) Remember a vivid resourceful state, 2) at peak apply a unique stimulus, 3) release and test. Use unique repeatable anchors. Don't anchor negative states.",
  "Submodalities": "Identify qualities: size, color, distance, brightness, volume. Swish: make problem image small/faint and resource image big/bright; repeat quickly. Contrasts do the heavy lifting.",
  "Strategies": "Ask: What do you see first? Then what? Where is it felt? Map steps and timing; introduce one new micro-step and rehearse. Change one micro-step per session.",
  "Finishers": "Finishers (use with care): Pattern Collapse Stack; Nested Loops Triple Bind; Yes Momentum Bomb. Warning: Use only with strong rapport & consent."
