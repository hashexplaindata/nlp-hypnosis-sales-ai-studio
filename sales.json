  "Foundations": "Selling = solving an identified problem. Uncover need, present solution, remove friction. Ethics: never sell what harms the client.",
  "Rapport": "Match tone, pace, and body language. Use short genuine disclosures to build trust. Find shared values quickly.",
  "NeedsDiscovery": "Ask open-ended questions: 'What would change if this was solved?' Listen for emotional drivers; summarize back what you heard.",
  "Pitch": "Lead with benefits, show transformation, add evidence. Use short demos or stories to anchor value. Contrast lesser option first, then core offer.",
  "Objections": "Welcome objections as signals. Acknowledge, isolate the real concern, use Feel-Felt-Found and proof stories.",
  "Closing": "Assumptive Close, Option Close, Scarcity Close (only if real). Ask directly after value is clear.",
  "FollowUp": "Send personalized thank-you and next steps. Deliver on promises quickly. Ask for referrals once trust is solid."
