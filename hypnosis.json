{
  "Foundations": "Hypnosis = focused attention + increased suggestibility + guided imagery. Goal: help people access resources and change automatic patterns—safely and with consent.",
  "PreTalk": "Explain simply what will happen. Obtain explicit consent: 'Are you okay to try this for a few minutes?' Set expectations; emphasize control and safety.",
  "Inductions": "Progressive relaxation (body scan); eye fixation (soft point); breath-paced induction (match & slow); fractionation (in/out cycles) — use carefully.",
  "Deepening": "Count down (10→1) linking each number to deeper calm. Fractionation: brief up/down cycles to deepen. Sensory narrowing: guide attention to a single sense.",
  "Suggestions": "Use positive, present-tense statements. Keep them short and sensory-rich. Embedded commands are subtle tonal shifts. Don't use negatives like 'don't be anxious'.",
  "Anchors": "Anchor at peak trance (touch, word). Chain anchors for stronger recall. Test anchors after reorientation; choose discreet anchors for real-world use.",
  "Finishers": "Advanced: Fractionation-Chain Anchoring; Time Distortion Collapse. Warning: use only with experience & consent."
